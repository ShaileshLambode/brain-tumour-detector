## Features

- Upload MRI scalp images in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` formats.  
- Classifies into four categories:  
  - **Glioma**  
  - **Meningioma**  
  - **Pituitary**  
  - **No Tumor**  
- Shows prediction along with confidence score (probability).  
- Clean, interactive UI via Streamlit.  
- Separation of concerns:  
  - `main.py` handles UI & user interaction  
  - `prediction_helper.py` handles model loading & inference

â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ prediction_helper.py
â”œâ”€â”€ Tumor_Prediction.pth       # Trained model weights

- **main.py**: Launches Streamlit app  
- **prediction_helper.py**: Model inference utilities  
- **Tumor_Prediction.pth**: Saved model file  
- **requirements.txt**: All package dependencies  

---

## Model Details

- Base architecture: **ResNet50** (preâ€‘trained on ImageNet)  
- Input image size: 224Ã—224 (or resized to match model)  
- Output classes: 4 (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, Noâ€‘Tumor)  
- Preprocessing: resizing, normalization to match ImageNetâ€™s mean & std  
- Inference: model loads weights from `Tumor_Prediction.pth`  

*(If you have details like dataset size, training/validation split, epochs, accuracy/loss curves, add them here.)*

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaileshLambode/brain-tumour-detector.git
   cd brain-tumour-detector
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Running the App

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open the web app in your default browser (usually at `localhost:8501` unless otherwise specified).

---

## Usage

- Once the app is running, upload an MRI image of the brain.  
- Click **Predict**.  
- The app will output:  
  1. The predicted tumor type (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor)  
  2. The confidence score (percentage) for that prediction

## Results & Metrics

| Metric              | Value        |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Number of classes    | 4              |
| Model Architecture   | ResNet50       |
| Data types           | MRI images (.jpg/.png) |
| Expected Accuracy*   | 98% |

\* To be filled once evaluation is done (validation/test accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

---

## Future Improvements

- Provide more detailed performance metrics: precision, recall, F1â€‘score, confusion matrix review.  
- Expand dataset (diverse images: different scanner machines, noise, image orientations).  
- Add data augmentation to improve robustness.  
- Possibly add explainability (Gradâ€‘CAM or heatmaps showing where the model looks).  
- Clip upload sizes / error & input validation.  
- Optionally package into a Docker container for easy deployment.
